# TSP
 Travelling salesman problem :
  An application that uses a set of cities (coordinates) and distances between
 them, finds best(shortest) tour (visiting all cities exactly once and returning to the origin city) in a given
 amount of time . Implemented this using Genetic algorithm and Simulated annealing separately and compare
 time and tour-cost.

 This was done in AI course.
